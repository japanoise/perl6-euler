# perl6-euler
My Project Euler solutions in Perl 6. Most of these are quick and dirty brute force efforts,
or have their theory cannibalized from somewhere. So, these should not be viewed as a guide
to solving the problem - just as a map through my process of learning Perl 6.

## Problems solved
- Problem 1: multiples of 3 and 5.p6
- Problem 2: fibeven.p6
- Problem 4: palindrome.p6
- Problem 6: sumsquare.p6
- Problem 8: largestproduct.p6
- Problem 9: triplet.p6
- Problem 13: largesum.p6
- Problem 16: powdigit.p6
